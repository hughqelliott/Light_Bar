# Light_Bar
This is the electronics portion of making a light bar. The carpentry, 3D printing, manufacture is sort of on you.

Control NeoPixel Strip via Adafriut's NeoPixel Library

3.7V Lithium Ion Rechargable battery with charger. I can't find my exact one, but they're out there. You need power.

Slip Ring with flange (allows for spinning your bar) if you don't want to spin it, don't bother with the flange.
I used the 12-wire but there is a 6-wire available.<br/>
